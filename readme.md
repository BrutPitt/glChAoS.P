## Latest features from ver.1.6 
<h3 align="center">  TransformFeedback â†’ multiDot particles emitter </h3>
Now all dp/dt attractors (yellow tag) have an additional new emitter type to visualize them in a progressive way and/or with multiDot (spray) effect.\
Is also possible to travel, in first person (cockpit view), within the particles, following the evolution of the attractors.

***Lorenz Attractor** - click on image to "explore" it in WebGL*  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*use "**v**" key or "**cockpit**" button (from **Attractors** tools window) to switch to subjective view (on right)*

<p>&nbsp;<br></p>


<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrutPitt/myRepos/master/glChAoSP/screenShots/cockpitSettings.jpg"/>

**New menu is available to adjust these settings:**


**1)** Panoramic/CockPit dots/s: different emitter speed for any view\
**2)** Number of dots for each step, real dots/s emitted are: `dots/s * Emit#`\
**3)** Multiplication factor of initial radial random speed\
**4)** Air friction/deceleration\
**5)** Point size: there are 3 different "pointSize" for: singleDot emitter, multiDot emitter and cockpitView\
**6)** Particles LifeTime, in sec.\
**7)** LifeTime attenuation: when the lifeTime ends, in *blending mode*, the particle attenuates the intensity of this factor, any second\
**8)** Wind direction and intensity (in units/s)\
**9)** Gravity/Acceleration direction and intensity (in units/s)\
**A)** Toggle cockpit view and related settings (following controls)\
**B)** Smoothing distance: in *blending mode* attenuates the intensity of near dots by distance\
**C)** Clipping distance: skip to draw closer particles\
**D)** PiP (Picture In Picture) feature\
**E)** TagretView is the current emitted dot, PointOfView is positioned on the wake: it adjusts the distance from head (it follows the attractor direction).\
**F)** Move back the PoV: it follows the vector *PoV -> TGT*\
**G)** Rotate the cam around TagretView, or better: around attractor head (last emitted dot), use reset to reposition the cam\
**H)** Move forward the TagretView position

<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

### Hardware required:

- **glChAoS.P** - GPU with OpenGL 4.1 or higher
- **wglChAoS.P** - Browser with WebGL2 capabilities (FireFox, Chrome or Chromium based browsers)

Theoretically all graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.0 supports also OpenGL 4.5, depends only from drivers (and O.S.)

About the GPUs that support the OpenGL 4.5 (with appropriate drivers and OS permitting):
- NVidia starting from GT/GTX 4xx series
- AMD starting from HD 5xxx series
- Intel starting from Ivy Bridge/Bay Trail CPUs (with HD 4000/2500 graphics)
  


### Hardware recommended:

- GPU starting from AMD HD 7970 / NVidia GTX 670 or with better performance
- CPU with 2 or more cores

### About performance
Glow effects, mostly with sigma \> 5, and DualPass/Shadows/AO requires expensive calculations in terms of performance

If you have slow performance try, in this order:
- Disable *DualPass* rendering and/or *AO* and/or *Shadows*
- Disable *GlowEffects* and/or *FXAA* 
- Prefer *Pointsprite*: on AMD and Intel GPU (sensible difference of performance) 
- Decrease number of particles buffer \< 3000
- Decrease point size (if you can)
- try squared 1024x1024 (power of 2) window size (from *Settings panel*)


### Supported Operating systems:

- [x] Microsoft Windows
- [x] Linux/Unix
- [x] Mac OS X
- [x] Android via webBrowser (**wglChAoS.P** WebGL/webAssembly, lightned version)

**Tested Operating System Versions:**

- Microsoft Windows 7/8.x/10
- Linux distributions: Ubuntu 16.04 -> 20.04, Fedora 27 -> 32
- Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave), 10.15 (Catalina)
- Android 5/6/7/8/9 with Firefox and Chrome


### Executables

No installation program is provided: just clone it form github or download the archive and decompress it in a folder whatever: only the internal directories structure must be preserved.

For Windows and Linux glChAoSP uses OpenGL 4.5 with AZDO (Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) and a separate thread (multithread) emitter/generator of particles with memory mapped directly on GPU vRAM.

On Mac OS X, for a limitation of the OS (from Mojave Apple have deprecated OpenGL) there is a downgraded version that use OpenGL 4.1 (higher possible) with a separate thread emitter/generator that uses the conventional CPU memory.

Are provided executable for the followings OS:

- **Windows**\
`glChAoSP.exe` and `glChAoSP_32.exe`: native executable (64 and 32 bit) are provided for OpenGL \>= 4.5: *Preferably use the 64-bit version*.
(you can recompile it, with appropriate define, to obtain an OpenGL 4.1 compliant)
\
`glChAoSP_viewports.exe`: beta version of multiple viewports is also provided (floating GUI windows that can go out outside of main Viewport/Window): (only 64 bits).
This is a great version, solid beta and full functional, but based on a *under development* version of  [**ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library.

- **Linux**\
`glChAoSP_Linux`: native executable (64 bit) is provided for OpenGL \>= 4.5: it was tested on Fedora and Ubuntu LTS. 
(you can recompile it, with appropriate define, to obtain an OpenGL 4.1 compliant)
\
Take care to have installed OpenGL library, whereas `libX11 libXext` should already be installed.\
\
After clone, copy or decompression, take care that executable bit of the file `glChAoSP_Linux` is active (chmod +x).\
Use `glChAoSP_Linux.sh` to launch it from fileBrowsers like Nautilus or Caja.

    - **wine**    
    The Windows executable, 32/64 bit, works fine also in wine 3.xx with no evident loss of performance

- **Mac OS**\
`glChAoSP_OSX`: native executable (64 bit) is provided for OpenGL 4.1
\
From *Finder* click on applescript: `glChAoSP_OSX.app`, or form command line type directly the command: `./glChAoSP_OSX`
\
It was tested on OS X ver 10.14 (Mojave) only, although with subsequent updates and different library versions you may need to rebuild it.
Read Build/CMake sections for further information.


**NOTE**:\
For **Windows** and **Linux** glChAoS.P uses OpenGL 4.5 with AZDO (Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) and a separate thread (multithread) emitter/generator of particles with memory mapped directly on GPU vRAM.

On **Mac OS**, for a limitation of the OS (from Mojave Apple have deprecated OpenGL) there is a downgraded version, that use OpenGL 4.1 (higher possible) with a separate thread emitter/generator that use the conventional CPU memory.

Furthers build option are provided:
- Use OpenGL 4.1 also on Windows and Linux.
- Single thread version.


<p>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

## To build [**glChAoS.P**](https://michelemorrone.eu/glchaosp)

### Build requirements

- Compilers with full C++14 standard required
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- ~~Boost Library to build DLA3D (Diffusion Limited Aggregation) object exploration, (or uncomment DISABLE_DLA3D in CMake file to disable it)~~ \
it has been replaced with **nanoflann** header-only (enclosed)


**Tested Compilers**

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019/2017/2015 (Platform Toolset v.142/141/140: it does not work with previous releases)
- MinGW (64bit) v.9
- CLang from v.5 to current
- GNU C++ from v.5 to current


**CMake**

In the folder `./src` there is the `CmakeLists.txt`, use this folder as base directory.

Read below more about your OS.

**GLFW Library**

Enclosed 32/64bit built library for Windows, and 64bit for Linux and OS X 
\
When build glChAoSP, compiler looks for GLFW library in the follows path:
- src/src/libs/glfw/buildLinux (Linux)
- src/src/libs/glfw/buildOSX (OSX)
- src/src/libs/glfw/buildWin (Windows)

You need to delete it, and/or modify the CMake file, to use personal ones version.
In this case you need to have installed GLFW Library, ver 3.3 or higher, or re-build the enclosed version in `./src/src/libs/glfw` folder.

### Build glChAoS.P in Windows 

Windows user needs of Visual Studio 2019 (it works also wit VS 2017/2015, but is need to change appropriate *Platform Toolset* and/or *Windows SDK version* that you have installed). In alternative, CMake 3.10 (or higher) for other compilers toolchain (non tested, but it should work).

- **Microsoft Visual Studio**
  - **VS solution**\
In the folder `./src/msBuilds` there is the solution project for use with Visual Studio 2017/2019.\
*(check appropriate **Platform Toolset** and/or **Windows SDK version** that you have installed)*\
You can use also **LLVM CLang** to build **glChAoS.P** from Visual Studio: you can use the LLVM plugin (after to have installed clang, in windows) and simply change the *toolchain* in *Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset*
     - The current VisualStudio solution refers to my environment variable RAMDISK (`R:`), and subsequent VS intrinsic variables to generate binary output:
`$(RAMDISK)\$(MSBuildProjectDirectoryNoRoot)\$(DefaultPlatformToolset)\$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\`\
Even without a RAMDISK variable, executable and binary files are outputted in base to the values of these VS variables, starting from root of current drive.

   - **VS with CMakeFile.txt and CMakeSettings.json** (testing fase - VS2019 only)   \
   Open `./src` folder in **vs2019** you can build both **Emscripten** / **CLang** inside Visual Studio



- **CMake**
    - You can use CMake to compile with CLang / MinGW, using mingw_make or ninja tool.


***NOTE:** To build *viewports* version you need to add `-DGLAPP_IMGUI_VIEWPORT` to compiler flags, or uncomment it in `appDefines.h`*

### Build glChAoS.P in Linux

**Tools required**\
Linux users need to install the GCC C/C++ v.5 or higher (or clang v.5 or higher) compilers and associated tools such as *make* and *CMake* (need v3.10 or higher).
\
To install gcc C/C++:
  - Debian, Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake cmake-qt-gui`
  - Fedora, RedHat: `sudo dnf install make gcc-c++ cmake cmake-gui`

 You need also to have installed OpenGL library and relative development package:
`libgl1-mesa libgl1-mesa-dev` (Ubuntu) or `mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel` (Fedora).

**Build**\
Form a *Terminal* window, just launch `sh build_glChAoSP.sh` script (from `./src` folder) to build **glChAoSP**, it first runs `cmake` with appropriate parameters and then starts `make` to build `glChAoSP_Linux` executable: it will stored in parent folder (`../`).

- the script uses the enclosed built version of GLFW

Another script, `buildLinux.sh`, is provided (as helper) to re-build GLFW: it calls `buildGLFW.sh` (to build/re-build GLFW) and `build_glChAoSP.sh` sequentially.
 - To build/rebuild GLFW from enclosed sources you must have installed also development packages: `libx11-dev libxext-dev` (Ubuntu) or `libX11-devel libXext-devel` (Fedora).\
**(documentation: [https://github.com/glfw/glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw))*

### Build glChAoS.P in Mac OS

**Tools required**
\
Mac users must have installed **Xcode** and the **Command Line Tools**, also **CMake 3.10** or higher is necessary.


**Build**\
Form a *Terminal* window, just launch `sh build_glChAoSP.sh` script (from `./src` folder) to build **glChAoSP**, it first runs `cmake` with appropriate parameters and then starts `make` to build `glChAoSP_OSX` executable: it will stored in parent folder (`../`)
- the script uses the enclosed built version of GLFW

Another script, `buildOSX.sh`, is provided (as helper) to re-build GLFW: it calls `buildGLFW.sh OSX` (to build/re-build GLFW) and `build_glChAoSP.sh` sequentially.\
**(documentation: [https://github.com/glfw/glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw))*


### Build wglChAoS.P with EMSCRIPTEN - WebGL via WebAssembly 

The CMake file is able to build also an [**EMSCRIPTEN**](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/index.html) version, obviously you need to have installed EMSCRIPTEN SDK on your computer (~~1.38.20~~ ~~1.38.28~~ 1.38.40 or higher).
Use `emsCMakeGen.cmd` or `emsCMakeGen.sh` from ./src directory, or look inside it, to pass appropriate defines/parameters to CMake command line.
`emsCMakeGen` need to know the location of EMSDK, and the "build-type" object to create.\
For example, run:

`emsCMakeGen.sh /opt/emsdk/emscripten/1.38.20 Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel wglChAoSP|wglChAoSP_lowres`


`emsCMakeGen.cmd C:\emsdk\emscripten\1.38.20 Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel`

To build the EMSCRIPTEN version, in Windows, with CMake, need to have **mingw32-make** in your computer and in the search PATH (only the make utility is enough) or **Ninja**.\
Currently all the shell/cmd scripts use **Ninja** to build **wglChAoS.P** (WebGL/WebAssembly release)

### Alternatives and optional, not closely necessary

Below there are some used components, which differ from **MIT** / **BSD 2-Clause** / **Zlib** license. 

**External Color Maps/Palettes - (optional - to load)**

- colorMaps/jjg\_gradient.json
colorMaps/jjg\_step.json â†’ J.J. Green palettes (creative commons noncommercial license)
[http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/jjg/ccolo/index.html](http://soliton.vm.bytemark.co.uk/pub/cpt-city/jjg/ccolo/index.html)  
**Conversion from gpf format to json 256 variations.*  

**optional separate files to load and to have more color maps*

**Alternative Library**

- **glm Math Library** - [https://glm.g-truc.net/](https://glm.g-truc.net/) 
  - Not more necessary.\
   Now is used my [**vgMath**](https://github.com/BrutPitt/vgMath) single file header, used also in [**vitualGizmo3D**](https://github.com/BrutPitt/virtualGizmo3D) and [**imGuIZMO.quat**](https://github.com/BrutPitt/imGuIZMO.quat) tools: it's a sub-set of **glm**, more compact, with or w/o template classes (selectable via define: `vgConfig.h`), and a studied **interface** that permits to switch between **glm** and **vgMath** only via compiler defines (`vgConfig.h`).

- **Boost Library** in particular: *function_output_iterator* and *geometry* are necessary **as alternative** (to nanoflann) to build DLA3D (Diffusion Limited Aggregation) object exploration in glChAoS.P (can be disabled). It's not included in the repository, but can be downloaded from [https://www.boost.org/](https://www.boost.org/)
It is not necessary to build the library, only headers files is enough. (more information in: how to build)
  - Compile with `-DGLAPP_USE_BOOST_LIBRARY` flag, to use instead of **nanoflann** lib
